      "The Ketogenic Diet is a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat eating plan that fundamentally changes how your body uses energy. By drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat, your body enters a metabolic state called ketosis, where it becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. Originally developed to treat epilepsy in the 1920s, the keto diet has shown promising results for people with type 2 diabetes by improving glycemic control and reducing medication needs. The diet's ability to stabilize blood sugar levels makes it an attractive option for diabetes management.",

A study in Nutrition & Metabolism showed that participants following a ketogenic diet improved their glycemic control and reduced or eliminated diabetes medications. The diet's ability to reduce insulin levels and improve insulin sensitivity makes it particularly beneficial for those with insulin resistance.",

      "The Paleo Diet, also known as the 'Caveman Diet' or 'Stone Age Diet,' is based on the premise of eating foods that our hunter-gatherer ancestors would have consumed during the Paleolithic era, which ended around 10,000 years ago. This diet focuses on whole, unprocessed foods like lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, while eliminating grains, legumes, dairy, and processed foods. For people with diabetes, the Paleo Diet may offer benefits through its emphasis on whole foods with a low glycemic impact, elimination of refined carbohydrates, and focus on nutrient-dense options that can help regulate blood sugar levels.",
